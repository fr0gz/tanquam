<p>My journey began studying Economics at the University of Chile, where I developed a foundation in analytical systems thinking. When the Estallido Social and the global pandemic disrupted my education, I didn’t stop—I adapted. I taught myself to code and began working at a law firm, eventually becoming both Partner and Data Engineer, leading legaltech initiatives focused on trademark law automation and internal tooling.
That experience was my first Bayesian update: real-world feedback showed me that I wanted to go deeper into technology, systems, and intelligent automation. I returned to formal studies—now majoring in Electronics Engineering at PUCV—where I’m expanding my skill set into AI, cloud infrastructure, and embedded intelligence.
Today, I apply a Bayesian Lean Loop to my career: I experiment through projects, validate by building tools and writing technical blog posts, and continuously refine my direction. IEEE journals fuel my learning, and my blog is where I process and share what I build.
I’m preparing to pursue an MS in Computer Science abroad, with the goal of joining a top global tech team working at the edge of machine learning, cloud systems, and real-world impact.
Let’s connect if you’re working on projects at the intersection of law, AI, systems engineering—or if you believe in experimentation as a career strategy.</p>
